    "The objective in this script is to extract Job profiles of Data Analysts in Massachusetts from https://Indeed.com. The prime source of extraction is through web scarping and the data is munged to obtain a consistent dataset. The data is extracted using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. Furthermore, the dataset is cleaned and audited to make it unique and error free.\n",

    "The conceptual form of the database is shown in the ER diagram.\n",

    "Once the cleaned dataset is obtained, the dataframe is converted to SQL using SQLAlchemy and the data is inserted. The database engine sqlite is then connected to jupyter notebook. Any queries can then be executed from jupyter notebook and the output is displayed."
